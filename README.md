### PassXYZ and .NET MAUI Book
PassXYZ is a cross platform version of password manager app compatible with KeePass database format. It was developed using Xamarin.Forms in the first edition. Recently, I rewrote it using .NET MAUI and shared my experience in my book [.NET MAUI Cross-Platform Application Development][1].

- `PassXYZ.Vault` - This is the first version using Xamarin.Forms
- `PassXYZ.Vault2` - This is the version using .NET MAUI
- `KPCLib` - This is a .NET Standard 2.0 port of KeePassLib
